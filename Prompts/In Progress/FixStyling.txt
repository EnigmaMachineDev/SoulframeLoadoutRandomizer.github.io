Currently, the reroll buttons are in the same rows as the text, and it is all centered, and everything changes position when the reroll buttons are clicked because they are on the same row.

Instead of this, change it to be more like individual sections for each roll. Then the reroll button should be in a fixed position to the right of the section it rerolls.

Also change the reroll button style to match the style of the reroll buttons on this site: https://grimdawncharacterrandomizer.github.io/. You can use that site as an example for the other changes as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the text and reroll buttons are in the same sections. Move the reroll buttons up to be next to the section headers, that way when they are clicked they do not change position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the reroll buttons and the text for the rolled values are correct, but the headers are still centered. This created a very odd look. Please Move the headers to the left just like the generated text they label, and put dividing lines between each section.
Also, the Generate Loadout button is way too small for the text in it. Change this button to be a rectangular button that holds the text in it.
Also, the reroll icons are not centered inside of the circular buttons they are in. Please fix that.
